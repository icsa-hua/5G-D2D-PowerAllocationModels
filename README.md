# 5G-D2D-PowerAllocationModels
A comparison of power allocation mechanisms for 5G D2D mobile communication networks

This project focuses on highlighting Device-to-Device (D2D) communications and power allocation mechanisms. The main goal of the project is to explore two simulation scenarios, each with different conditions, using MATLAB as the platform.

## Getting Started

To run the simulations for this project, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new project in MATLAB.
2. Copy all the project files to the project folder.
3. Map the MATLAB platform to the project directory from the home screen.
4. Execute the `Scenarios.m` script file to run the simulations.

## Simulation Scenarios

The project includes two main simulation scenarios, each showcasing different conditions related to D2D communications. The scenarios are implemented in the `Scenarios.m` file. You can explore and modify this file to experiment with various simulation setups.
